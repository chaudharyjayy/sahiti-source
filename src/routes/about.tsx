          <p>
            Sahiti is a prototype built for Smart India Hackathon 2026, against the Ministry of
            Social Justice and Empowerment problem statement 26091.
          </p>
          <p>
            The problem it works on is narrow. A first-time rural business owner usually does not
            know how much finance their own savings can unlock, what paperwork the bank will ask
            for, or how crowded their own locality already is. Most of that knowledge sits with
            people who have already borrowed. Sahiti tries to put it in one place.

              <li key={item} className="flex gap-3">
                <span className="mt-2 size-1.5 shrink-0 rounded-full bg-saffron" aria-hidden="true" />
                <span>{item}</span>
              </li>
            ))}
          </ul>

          <h2 className="font-display text-xl font-semibold text-foreground">What it is not</h2>
          <p>
            Sahiti is not a lender, not a government portal and not a financial adviser. Scheme
            terms and eligibility change, so confirm them with the bank or on udyamimitra.in before
            you act. The Lohegaon zone scores are demonstration research built for this prototype.
            Shop listings come from OpenStreetMap and are factual locations, not endorsements.
